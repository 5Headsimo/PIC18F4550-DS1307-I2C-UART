# Real Time Clock Monitor Project 

DS1307 RTC interface on PIC18F4550 and communication via I2C and UART.

## Project Overview

The project consist of a transmitter PIC18F4550 and a receiver one. The Transmitter microcontroller collects RTC Data through I2C, while the receiver microcontroller gets the RTC Data through UART and decodes it into a redable clock with a calendar that is shown in a 16x2 LCD.

The project was simulated in Proteus v8.10 SP3 and works fine but with a high CPU usage.
